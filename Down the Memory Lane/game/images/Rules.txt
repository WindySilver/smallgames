RULES
-Credit "Noraneko Games" 
-Credit can be given in the in-game credits, in a note accompanying the game, or on a website where the project is downloaded. Any one of those is fine. It doesn't have to be all of them.
-If re-uploaded to another site for download, do not remove this text file or any part of it.
-These assets cannot be sold as is. For merchandising options, contact me and we can discuss.
-Modifications are allowed. (Change colors, new pose, new hairstyle, change clothes, holding things, add blood splatters, makeup, etc)
-Using for 18+ is fine as long as it doesn't contain illegal themes/content that could reflect poorly on the Noraneko Games name and reputation. 
-Commercial use in a game is ok if you just let me know you are using it and can provide proof of credit. Contact me for commercial use outside of games.
-If you aren't making money from your project, you can use without contacting me if you'd prefer.
-Using this asset for Game Jams and Contests is okay!
-If you want to use this media for anything other than a game, make sure it follows the rules above.
-Not required, but I would love for you to link me to your project!
