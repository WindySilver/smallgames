The player has amnesia (due to rebirth?) and their friend is trying to remind them of who they were by visiting familiar places, mainly the friend's childhood home (opening). There is the option to say that you do remember, but they won't believe you, especially since you cannot answer their questions correctly (buildup). The climax comes when the friend gets frustrated and despairs over the fact that they lost their partner/BFF once, then got them back and yet they feel like they're losing them again. You can try to calm them down, apologize for the lack of memories or reassure them that you will remember, it just takes far more time.

The resolution depends on the response to the problem: the first angers the friend and they walk away, the second makes them feel guilty and they end the visit there and the last one makes the friend feel hopeful and they finish the visit. The endings also depend on them.

First: Entrance. Feels strange to be back after all these years.
Second: House. First question. Do you remember your childhood home?
Third: Outdoor dining. Reminiscing Jake's family. What do you remember of them?
Fourth: Swing. Childhood memories. Sylvia gets anxious about the lack of progress.
Fifth: Garden path. The confrontation.
Sixth: Greenhouse. Sylvia mulls over what happened. Not much speaking aside from discussing the greenhouse.
Seventh: The ending at the bridge leading away from home where they spent a ton of time.
